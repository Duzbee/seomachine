## Internal Linking Best Practices

When adding internal links to content:

2. **Vary Anchor Text**: Use different phrases for the same destination URL
3. **3-5 Links Per Article**: Aim for 3-5 strategic internal links in homepage/main content
4. **Deep Linking**: Link to specific game pages, not just homepage
5. **Early Links Matter**: Links in the first few paragraphs carry more weight
