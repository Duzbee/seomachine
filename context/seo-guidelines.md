# SEO Guidelines for RustCasino Content

This document outlines SEO best practices and requirements for all RustCasino content to maximize organic search visibility and rankings.

## Content Length Requirements

### Target Word Counts
- **Homepage Article**: Length determined by SERP analysis of top competitors
- **Standard Blog Post**: 1,500-2,500 words
- **Game Page Content**: 500-1,000 words
- **FAQ Sections**: Comprehensive answers (50-150 words each)

### Important Length Guidelines
- **SERP-Driven Length**: For primary keywords like "rust gambling", analyze top 10 competitors to determine optimal length
- **Quality over padding**: Every word should add value
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Cover all aspects users search for
- **FAQ completeness**: Answer all common questions thoroughly

### Why Length Matters
- Longer, comprehensive content typically ranks higher
- More words = more keyword opportunities
- Thorough content signals expertise
- Users looking for gambling info want complete answers

## Keyword Optimization

### Keyword Research Requirements
Before writing any article:
1. Identify primary target keyword
2. Analyze top 10 SERP competitors
3. Identify 3-5 secondary/related keywords
4. List LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing) keywords
5. Gather FAQ questions from "People Also Ask"

### Keyword Density Guidelines
- **Primary Keyword**: 1-2% density
  - Natural integration is critical -- never force keywords
  - Use variations to avoid repetition
- **Secondary Keywords**: 0.5-1% density each
- **LSI Keywords**: Sprinkle throughout naturally

### Critical Keyword Placement
Primary keyword MUST appear in:
- [ ] H1 headline (near the beginning)
- [ ] First 100 words of article
- [ ] At least 2-3 H2 subheadings
- [ ] Last paragraph / conclusion
- [ ] Meta title (within first 60 characters)
- [ ] Meta description
- [ ] URL slug (for non-homepage content)

### Keyword Integration Best Practices
- **Natural language first**: Write for humans, optimize for search engines
- **Use variations**: Don't repeat exact phrase robotically
  - Example: "rust gambling" > "Rust skin gambling" > "gambling with Rust skins"
- **Question formats**: Include conversational variations
  - "What is Rust gambling" vs "Rust gambling explained"
- **Semantic keywords**: Use related terms to support topical authority
  - For "rust gambling": include "skins", "cases", "provably fair", "house edge"

### Keyword Stuffing (Avoid)
Bad: "Rust gambling is the best rust gambling for rust gambling fans who love rust gambling on rust gambling sites."

Good: "Rust gambling combines the excitement of casino games with the value of your skin collection. From case opening to competitive battles, there's a game for every player."

## Content Structure Requirements
